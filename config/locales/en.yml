# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

  #About page
  about_para1: I always felt like the task of creating your cover letter for any government of Canada job was a very tedious job.
  about_para2: "I believe that most have a system similar to mine... You try your best to backup your previous sumissions in case there is something useful in there that you can re-use in your future job applications. When that time comes, you can't figure out in which document you answered a question that is somewhat similar to the one you're filling out. Then what happens? You have to fill it out all over again... Boring, boring, boring."
  about_head1: I created this small app to make my life easier.
  about_para3: By creating an online place with everything I answered in previous applications and built something to make it easier for myself to retrieve the information I need when applying for a new job within the government.
  about_para4: If this appeals to you, I invite it to use it as well.
  about_head2: Cheers, and good luck with your government of Canada application!

  #Help
  help_para1: Once you create an account (and confirm its email address) and log in for the first time the home page will turn into your personnal page.
  help_head1: This is where the magic happens
  help_para2: >
    There and then, you can click the "Add New Item" button which will let you add a new item. Since not everything in a cover letter 
    is is the "question / answer" format I've kept the wording general by using "Title" and "Content".
  help_para3: 'Simply fill those two fields and click the "Save" button.'
  help_head2: This is cool but how to I search?
  help_para4: "Once you have one item or more, a search bar will appear on your homepage. Type a word that is in either your title or content and see before your eyes your results show up."
  help_head3: Copy and paste keyboard shortcut
  help_para5: >
    Simply select the paragraph you wish to copy and press <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd></kbd> (<kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd></kbd> on Mac) 
    to copy and <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd></kbd> (<kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd></kbd> on Mac) to paste onto your document. Tada!
